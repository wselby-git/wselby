; IBM Power1 Instruction Set Architecture

; Set up registers

mov rax, 0x0 ; Initialize accumulator
mov rbx, 0x0 ; Initialize base register
mov rcx, 0x0 ; Initialize counter

; Memory operations

mov [rdx], rax ; Store value in accumulator to memory address in rdx
mov rax, [rdx] ; Load value from memory address in rdx to accumulator

; Arithmetic operations

add rax, rbx ; Add values in accumulator and base register, store result in accumulator
sub rax, rbx ; Subtract values in base register from accumulator, store result in accumulator
mul rax, rbx ; Multiply values in accumulator and base register, store result in accumulator
div rax, rbx ; Divide values in accumulator by base register, store result in accumulator

; Logical operations

and rax, rbx ; Logical AND between values in accumulator and base register, store result in accumulator
or rax, rbx ; Logical OR between values in accumulator and base register, store result in accumulator
xor rax, rbx ; Logical XOR between values in accumulator and base register, store result in accumulator

; Shift and rotate operations

shl rax, rcx ; Shift bits in accumulator left by value in counter, store result in accumulator
shr rax, rcx ; Shift bits in accumulator right by value in counter, store result in accumulator
rol rax, rcx ; Rotate bits in accumulator left by value in counter, store result in accumulator
ror rax, rcx ; Rotate bits in accumulator right by value in counter, store result in accumulator

; Compare operations

cmp rax, rbx ; Compare values in accumulator and base register
je  label ; Jump to label if values are equal
jne label ; Jump to label if values are not equal

; Branch operations

jmp label ; Jump to label unconditionally
call label ; Call subroutine at label
ret ; Return from subroutine

; Miscellaneous operations

halt ; Halt execution
nop ; No operation (do nothing)
